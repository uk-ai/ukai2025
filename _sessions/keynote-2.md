Dr Anjali Mazumder from The Alan Turing Institute will discuss the opportunities and challenges to building responsible and inclusive systems.

Anjali is an interdisciplinary research leader with over 15 years’ experience tackling fundamental data problems of societal importance – in justice, law, health, education, labour, finance, defence and security, humanitarian sectors – working at the intersection of research, policy and practice in the UK, the US, and Canada, forging multi-disciplinary and cross-sector collaborations.  She is currently the Director of AI, Accountability, Inclusion and Rights (AIR) at The Alan Turing Institute where she co-leads a cross-institutional interdisciplinary research programme (AIR) ensuring AI and related technologies are human-centred for the benefit of all.

Her work bridges statistics, computer science, design, psychometrics, law and policy to design, develop and evaluate socio-technical interventions placing rights, accountability, safety and participation at the core of responsible data and AI research, innovation, practice and governance. She has led institutional research programmes and delivers strategic advice on national and international research projects, agendas and organisational boards relating to responsible data and AI. She was ministerially appointed (2012-2018) to serve on the Canadian national committee to advise on responsible data collection and use of DNA. She is currently an elected council member of the Royal Statistical Society and serves on the Research Advisory Board of the Educational Testing Service. She has been elected to and serves her academic, professional and institutional communities in a number of ways to improve and enable responsible data/AI, equity, safety, participation and assurance in scientific development. (Anjali holds a doctorate in Statistics from University of Oxford and two masters - one in statistics and one in measurement and evaluation - both from the University of Toronto.)
