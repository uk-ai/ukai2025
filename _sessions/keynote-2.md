A keynote talk from Professor Carl Henrik Ek from University of Cambridge on bayesian inference.

Carl Henrik is a Professor of Statistical Learning at the University of Cambridge 
a visiting Professor at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and a Docent in Machine 
Learning at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. He is the co-Director 
for the UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in Decision Making for Complex Systems 
which is a collaboration between University of Cambridge and the University of Manchester.

 His research focus on how we can specify data efficient and interpretable assumptions that 
 allows us to learn from small amounts of data. Most of his work is focused on Bayesian 
 non-parametric methods and in specific Gaussian processes.

Before joining the Computer Lab in Cambridge Carl Henrik was a Senior Lecturer at the 
University of Bristol, prior to this he was an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning 
at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. He did his postdoctoral research 
at University of California at Berkeley and his PhD is from Oxford Brookes University.
