Dr Sanson Poon from the Natural History Museum AI Lab will deliver a plenary talk on the second day of UK AI 2025.

Dr Sanson Poon is the founder of the NHM AI Lab at the Natural History Museum, London. He leads initiatives that bring data science and AI into research workflows across earth and life sciences — from biodiversity analysis to collections digitisation. With a background in physics and experience across healthcare, government, and industry, Dr Poon’s work helps institutions apply AI as a powerful tool for scientific discovery and operational impact. This keynote will explore how AI is transforming natural science research — from early experiments in a museum lab to the development of a national programme — and offer insights into real-world applications of AI in scientific domains.
